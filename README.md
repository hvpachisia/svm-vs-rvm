## Analyzing the usefulness of SVMs v. RVMs when predicting breast cancer

This project aimed to investigate and compare the performance of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Relevance Vector Machines (RVMs) in classifying benign and malignant breast tumors. We introduce the mechanisms of how SVMSâ€™s work, their usefulness, and potential drawbacks and analyze why RVM in classifying tumors can lead to better results. In the end, comparing several models determine that an RVM model gives greater accuracy scores compared to SVM model.

This project was undertaken with two other people (Jonathan Juarez and Shwetha Srinivasan) as a final project for the Mathematics for Machine Learning class at UChicago. It contains the following:

1. A Jupyter Notebook with the code ran for the project.
2. A report as a 4-page NeurIPS-format extended abstract that contains our findings.
